## 🎯 Inspiration

This CSS Art captures the *real-life hustle and chaos of modern office life* — overflowing browser tabs, sticky notes, coffee mugs, glowing meeting tabs, and a buzzing keyboard. It reflects a typical day in the life of a developer/designer, juggling too many things at once.

## 💡 Journey

This piece was a fun but challenging dive into *pure CSS art*. I focused on:
- Realistic proportions and layouts
- Steam effect using pure CSS animation
- Designing a realistic keyboard without JavaScript
- Creative tab overflow simulation for a “Browser Tabs Hell” look

I’m proud of the attention to detail — like the coffee steam, the glowing meeting tab, and the realistic office desk setup.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- CSS pseudo-elements are powerful!
- Carefully stacked `z-index` and transforms can create great visual depth
- Simulating real objects (like desks, steam, keyboards) without JS is challenging — but rewarding
